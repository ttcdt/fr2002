NOTE: This silly game is now hosted by the TTCDT: don't bother the
original authors about them. We at the TTCDT also don't plan to make
any real maintenance on this, just to host it and give love to the
MS Windows executables. If you want to rebuild this code from scratch
you'll need the filp and qdgdf libraries -- Theodore from the ttcdt (2019)

Freaks 2.002 is a port of Freaks! [1], a 3D maze and monster smashing
adventure developed in the 90's, to newer architectures. The original code
was too MSDOS-dependent (including big chunks of Turbo Assembler!), so a
remake using the QDGDF [2] library was done to boost portability. On the
way, some new features were implemented:

 * Full angle rotation (not limited to the original 90 degree steps),
 * Engine improvements (depth cue lighting, better sounds management),
 * Map definitions and some game logic rewritten in a higher-level
   language (using Filp [3]),
 * More ambientation (rain, lightning storms, etc).

The game idea is mostly unchanged; the only difference is that life is not
replenished after killing a monster, but after passing over a corpse (as if
"feeding" from it).

This software is released into the public domain.
